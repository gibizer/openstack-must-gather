# Function to run commands in background without exceeding $CONCURRENCY
# processes in parallel.
# The recommendation is to use this function at the deepest level that can be
# parallelized and not at the highest.
# For normal commands:
#    run_bg echo hola
# For commands that run multiple commands we can play with strings:
#    run_bg 'sleep 10 && echo hola'
#    run_bg sleep 10 '&& echo hola'
#    run_bg sleep 10 '&&' echo hola
#    run_bg echo hola '>' myfile.txt
#
# For now these methods ignore errors on the calls that are made in the
# background.
